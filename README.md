# onSets
This is the mobile version of onSets a game modeled after AGLOA OnSets. This is a project using sockets to allow for live collaboration
between clients playing the game.

To run this project yourself, clone or download the repository and make sure that you have node installed. Find the project in terminal
then do a node install followed by a node start. This will allow you to run the project locally. From that point you can open up a few tabs to see client interactinos and give it a go! Have fun!
